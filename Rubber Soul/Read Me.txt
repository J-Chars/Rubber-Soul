  = Q & A =


 Q : Why Rubber? 

 A : Rubber Soul is a pretty interesting character in Heritage for the Future, and has some high potential in being made and
     tailored to fit in a CvS environment.


 Q : What's his playstyle like?

 A : Rubber Soul is changed heavily in order to accomodate for being balanced in a more CvS-ish environment, so while his mobility
     is kept the same, his pressure is different from source in order to not make his offense impossible to deal with. 


 Q : How do you play Rubber?

 A : Rubber is a defensive oriented character with great pressure and offensive tools, however his mobility is slow and has a hard time
     dealing with hard pressure and zoning. His buttons are overall fairly solid and are good to use in neutral, such as st.HP, which has
     a fair amount of priority, and can be cancelled into Rubber Splash to be safe. Same with other good moves like cr.MP, which can also
     be cancelled into Rubber Splash to be a more safe blockstring. His neutral needs to be a little more precise than normal in order to
     be able to run his gameplan of either playing defensive or pressing hard (depending on the matchup). Just use his good buttons, and
     make sure to use good mixups and juggles off of wrap setups and also make good use of tick throws in order to deal the damage you need.
